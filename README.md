Providing workflows and tools for Swedish biodiversity data: from data access, data handling and organisation, to analysis.

There is a folder labelled CRAN_data which can bring information about linked packages from CRAN. It also includes the xlsx that was orginally given this. This has a large spreadsheet with summary information on packages and Indicators which will need to split out.

BDcleaneer has data for an example. It is a species which is treated as two in GBIF though it is only one
