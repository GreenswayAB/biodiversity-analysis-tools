Quantitative liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) proteomics can measure relative protein abundance on a system-wide scale. To estimate absolute quantitative information using these relative abundance measurements requires additional information such as heavy-labeled references of known concentration. Multiple methods have been using different references and strategies; some are easily available whereas others require more effort on the users end. Hence, we believe the field might benefit from making some of these methods available under an automated framework, which also facilitates validation of the chosen strategy. We have implemented the most commonly used absolute label-free protein abundance estimation methods for LC-MS/MS modes quantifying on either MS1-, MS2-levels or spectral counts together with validation algorithms to enable automated data analysis and error estimation. Specifically, we used Monte-carlo cross-validation and bootstrapping for model selection and imputation of proteome-wide absolute protein quantity estimation.

It is more stringent than controlling the false discovery rate, and possesses theoretical robustness to positive correlations between tests and unequal weights. It is a multi-level test in the sense that a superset of one or more significant tests is certain to be significant and conversely when the superset is non-significant, the constituent tests are certain to be non-significant. It is based on MAMML (model averaging by mean maximum likelihood), a frequentist analogue to Bayesian model averaging, and is theoretically grounded in generalized central limit theorem.

Trees with a user-specified number of extant tips, or a user-specified stem age are simulated. It is possible to assume any probability distribution for the waiting time until speciation and extinction. Furthermore, the waiting times to speciation / extinction may be scaled in different parts of the tree, meaning we can simulate trees with clade-dependent diversification processes. At a speciation event, one species splits into two. We allow for two different modes at these splits: (i) symmetric, where for every speciation event new waiting times until speciation and extinction are drawn for both daughter lineages; and (ii) asymmetric, where a speciation event results in one species with new waiting times, and another that carries the extinction time and age of its ancestor. The symmetric mode can be seen as an vicariant or allopatric process where divided populations suffer equal evolutionary forces while the asymmetric mode could be seen as a peripatric speciation where a mother lineage continues to exist.

This is accomplished through comparison of input sequences against a profile hidden Markov     model (PHMM) using the Viterbi algorithm (for algorithm details see Durbin et al. 1998,     ISBN: 9780521629713). Inserted base pairs are removed and deleted base pairs are accounted     for through the introduction of a placeholder character. Since the PHMM is a probabilistic     representation of the COI barcode, corrections are not always perfect. For this reason     'debar' censors base pairs adjacent to reported indel sites, turning them into placeholder     characters (default is 7 base pairs in either direction, this feature can be disabled).    Testing has shown that this censorship results in the correct sequence length being restored,     and erroneous base pairs being masked the vast majority of the time (>95%). "

When conditioning on the number of final tips, the method allows for shifts in rates and mass extinction events during the birth-death process (sim.rateshift.taxa()). The function sim.bd.age() (and sim.rateshift.taxa() without extinction) allow the speciation rate to change in a density-dependent way. The LTT plots of the simulations can be displayed using LTT.plot(), LTT.plot.gen() and LTT.average.root(). TreeSim further samples trees with n final tips from a set of trees generated by the common sampling algorithm stopping when a fixed number m>>n of tips is first reached (sim.gsa.taxa()). This latter method is appropriate for m-tip trees generated under a big class of models (details in the sim.gsa.taxa() man page). For incomplete phylogeny, the missing speciation events can be added through simulations (corsim()). (ii) sim.rateshifts.taxa() is generalized to sim.bdsky.stt() for serially sampled trees, where the trees are conditioned on either the number of sampled tips or the age. Furthermore, for a multitype-branching process with sequential sampling, trees on a fixed number of tips can be simulated using sim.bdtypes.stt.taxa().

"Canopy",1,1,4,"2017-04-08 22:30","A statistical framework and computational procedure for identifying  the sub-populations within a tumor, determining the mutation profiles of each   subpopulation, and inferring the tumor's phylogenetic history. The input are   variant allele frequencies (VAFs) of somatic single nucleotide alterations   (SNAs) along with allele-specific coverage ratios between the tumor and matched  normal sample for somatic copy number alterations (CNAs). These quantities can  be directly taken from the output of existing software. Canopy provides a   general mathematical framework for pooling data across samples and sites to   infer the underlying parameters. For SNAs that fall within CNA regions, Canopy  infers their temporal ordering and resolves their phase.  When there are   multiple evolutionary configurations consistent with the data, Canopy outputs   all configurations along with their confidence assessment."

The single cell mapper (scMappR) R package contains a suite of bioinformatic tools that provide experimentally relevant cell-type specific information to a list of differentially expressed genes (DEG). The function ""scMappR_and_pathway_analysis"" reranks DEGs to generate cell-type specificity scores called cell-weighted fold-changes. Users input a list of DEGs, normalized counts, and a signature matrix into this function. scMappR then re-weights bulk DEGs by cell-type specific expression from the signature matrix, cell-type proportions from RNA-seq deconvolution and the ratio of cell-type proportions between the two conditions to account for changes in cell-type proportion. With cwFold-changes calculated, scMappR uses two approaches to utilize cwFold-changes to complete cell-type specific pathway analysis. The ""process_dgTMatrix_lists"" function in the scMappR package contains an automated scRNA-seq processing pipeline where users input scRNA-seq count data, which is made compatible for scMappR and other R packages that analyze scRNA-seq data. We further used this to store hundreds up regularly updating signature matrices. The functions ""tissue_by_celltype_enrichment"", ""tissue_scMappR_internal"", and ""tissue_scMappR_custom"" combine these consistently processed scRNAseq count data with gene-set enrichment tools to allow for cell-type marker enrichment of a generic gene list (e.g. GWAS hits).

"Irescale",1,1,3,"2019-04-15 23:22","Provides a scaling method to obtain a standardized Moran's I measure. Moran's I is a measure for the spatial autocorrelation of a data set, it gives a measure of similarity between data and its surrounding. The range of this value must be [-1,1], but this does not happen in practice. This package scale the Moran's I value and map it into the theoretical range of [-1,1]. Once the Moran's I value is rescaled, it facilitates the comparison between projects, for instance, a researcher can calculate Moran's I in a city in China, with a sample size of n1 and area of interest a1. Another researcher runs a similar experiment in a city in Mexico with different sample size, n2, and an area of interest a2. Due to the differences between the conditions, it is not possible to compare Moran's I in a straightforward way. In this version of the package, the spatial autocorrelation Moran's I is calculated as proposed in Chen(2013) <arXiv:1606.03658>."

The specificity of this method relies on the derivation of multiple predictor variables from the	movement data over a range of temporal windows.

Principle 1 determines all sensible univariate relationships in the spirit of the Markovian process. The relationship between each pair of variables, including predictors and the final outcome variable, is determined with the Markovian property that the value of the current predictor is sufficient in relating to the next level variable, i.e., the relationship is independent of the specific value of the preceding-level variables to the current predictor, given the current value. Principle 2 resembles the multiple regression principle in the way multiple predictors are considered simultaneously. Specifically, the relationship of the first-level predictors (such as Time and irradiance etc) to the outcome variable (such as, module degradation or yellowing)  is fit by a supervised additive model. Then each significant intermediate variable is taken as the new outcome variable and the other variables (except the final outcome variable) as the predictors in investigating the next-level multivariate relationship by a supervised additive model. This fitting process is continued until all sensible models are investigated."

Provides new methods for the so-called Free-response Receiver Operating Characteristic (FROC) analysis. The ultimate aim of FROC analysis is to compare observer performances, which means comparing characteristics, such as area under the curve (AUC) or figure of merit (FOM). In this package, we only use the notion of AUC for modality comparison, where by ""modality"",  we mean imaging methods such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Computed Tomography (CT), Positron Emission Tomography (PET), ..., etc. So there is a problem that which imaging method is better to detect lesions from shadows in radiographs. To solve modality comparison issues, this package provides new methods using hierarchical Bayesian models proposed by the author of this package. Using this package, one can obtain at least one conclusion that which imaging methods are better for finding lesions in radiographs with the case of your data. Fitting FROC statistical models is sometimes not so good, it can easily confirm by drawing FROC curves and comparing these curves and the points constructed by False Positive fractions (FPFs) and True Positive Fractions (TPFs), we can validate the goodness of fit intuitively. Such validation is also implemented by the Chi square goodness of fit statistics in the Bayesian context which means that the parameter is not deterministic, thus by integrating it with the posterior predictive measure, we get a desired value. To compare modalities (imaging methods: MRI, CT, PET, ... , etc),  we evaluate AUCs for each modality. FROC is developed by Dev Chakraborty, his FROC model in his 1989 paper relies on the maximal likelihood methodology. The author modified and provided the alternative Bayesian FROC model. Strictly speaking, his model does not coincide with models in this package. In FROC context, we means by multiple reader and multiple case (MRMC) the case of the number of reader or modality is two or more. The MRMC data is available for functions of this package. I hope that medical researchers use not only the frequentist method but also alternative Bayesian methods. In medical research, many problems are considered under only frequentist methods, such as the notion of p-values. But p-value is sometimes misunderstood. Bayesian methods provide very simple, direct, intuitive answer for research questions. Combining frequentist methods with Bayesian methods, we can obtain more reliable answer for research questions.

Principle 1 determines all sensible univariate relationships in the spirit of the Markovian process. The relationship between each pair of variables, including predictors and the final outcome variable, is determined with the Markovian property that the value of the current predictor is sufficient in relating to the next level variable, i.e., the relationship is independent of the specific value of the preceding-level variables to the current predictor, given the current value. Principle 2 resembles the multiple regression principle in the way multiple predictors are considered simultaneously. Specifically, the relationship of the first-level predictors (such as Time and irradiance etc) to the outcome variable (such as, module degradation or yellowing)  is fit by a supervised additive model. Then each significant intermediate variable is taken as the new outcome variable and the other variables (except the final outcome variable) as the predictors in investigating the next-level multivariate relationship by a supervised additive model. This fitting process is continued until all sensible models are investigated."
"escalation",3,1,3,"2020-04-14 17:10","Methods for working with dose-finding clinical trials.

"BayesianFROC",2,1,11,"2020-07-02 12:00","Execute BayesianFROC::fit_GUI_Shiny() (or fit_GUI_Shiny_MRMC()) for a graphical user interface via Shiny.  Provides new methods for the so-called Free-response Receiver Operating Characteristic (FROC) analysis. The ultimate aim of FROC analysis is to compare observer performances, which means comparing characteristics, such as area under the curve (AUC) or figure of merit (FOM). In this package, we only use the notion of AUC for modality comparison, where by ""modality"",  we mean imaging methods such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Computed Tomography (CT), Positron Emission Tomography (PET), ..., etc. So there is a problem that which imaging method is better to detect lesions from shadows in radiographs. To solve modality comparison issues, this package provides new methods using hierarchical Bayesian models proposed by the author of this package. Using this package, one can obtain at least one conclusion that which imaging methods are better for finding lesions in radiographs with the case of your data. Fitting FROC statistical models is sometimes not so good, it can easily confirm by drawing FROC curves and comparing these curves and the points constructed by False Positive fractions (FPFs) and True Positive Fractions (TPFs), we can validate the goodness of fit intuitively. Such validation is also implemented by the Chi square goodness of fit statistics in the Bayesian context which means that the parameter is not deterministic, thus by integrating it with the posterior predictive measure, we get a desired value. To compare modalities (imaging methods: MRI, CT, PET, ... , etc),  we evaluate AUCs for each modality. FROC is developed by Dev Chakraborty, his FROC model in his 1989 paper relies on the maximal likelihood methodology. The author modified and provided the alternative Bayesian FROC model. Strictly speaking, his model does not coincide with models in this package. In FROC context, we means by multiple reader and multiple case (MRMC) the case of the number of reader or modality is two or more. The MRMC data is available for functions of this package. I hope that medical researchers use not only the frequentist method but also alternative Bayesian methods. In medical research, many problems are considered under only frequentist methods, such as the notion of p-values. But p-value is sometimes misunderstood. Bayesian methods provide very simple, direct, intuitive answer for research questions. Combining frequentist methods with Bayesian methods, we can obtain more reliable answer for research questions.

In addition to the    ""NPC"" function, which performs nonparametric combination itself, the    package also contains a number of helper functions, many of which calculate    a test statistic given an input of data."

For the item parameter estimation, marginal maximum likelihood estimation     with expectation-maximization (MMLE-EM) algorithm     (Bock & Aitkin (1981) <doi:10.1007/BF02294168>) is used.

By with this package, the converted scale values of all items in a measurement instrument can be calculated by estimating a category parameter set for each item. Thus, the calculations can be made without any need to usage of the common category parameter set. Through this package, the psychological distances of the items are scaled. The scaling of a category parameter set for each item cause differentiation of score of the categories will be got from items. Also, the total measurement instrument score of an individual can be calculated according to the scaling of item score categories by with this package.This package provides that the place of individuals related to the structure to be measured with a measurement instrument consisted of polytomously scored items can be reveal more accurately.

By with this package, the converted scale values of all items in a measurement instrument can be calculated by estimating a category parameter set for each item. Thus, the calculations can be made without any need to usage of the common category parameter set. Through this package, the psychological distances of the items are scaled. The scaling of a category parameter set for each item cause differentiation of score of the categories will be got from items. Also, the total measurement instrument score of an individual can be calculated according to the scaling of item score categories by with this package.This package provides that the place of individuals related to the structure to be measured with a measurement instrument consisted of polytomously scored items can be reveal more accurately.

According to Muraki, this assumption must be tested. In the examination process of this assumption, the fit indexes are obtained and evaluated. This package provides that this assumption is removed. By with this package, the converted scale values of all items in a measurement instrument can be calculated by estimating a category parameter set for each item. Thus, the calculations can be made without any need to usage of the common category parameter set. Through this package, the psychological distances of the items are scaled. The scaling of a category parameter set for each item cause differentiation of score of the categories will be got from items. Also, the total measurement instrument score of an individual can be calculated according to the scaling of item score categories by with this package.This package provides that the place of individuals related to the structure to be measured with a measurement instrument consisted of polytomously scored items can be reveal more accurately. In this way, it is thought that the results obtained about individuals can be made more sensitive, and the differences between individuals can be revealed more accurately. On the other hand, it can be argued that more accurate evidences can be obtained regarding the psychometric properties of the measurement instruments."

STEPCAM is a STEPwise Community Assembly Model that infers              the relative contribution of Dispersal Assembly, Habitat Filtering              and Limiting Similarity from a dataset consisting of the              combination of trait and abundance data.

"Select",1,1,5,"2018-04-02 21:36","The objective of these functions is to derive a species assemblage    that satisfies a functional trait profile. Restoring resilient ecosystems    requires a flexible framework for selecting assemblages that are based on the    functional traits of species. However, current trait-based models have been    limited to algorithms that can only select species by optimising specific trait    values, and could not elegantly accommodate the common desire among restoration    ecologists to produce functionally diverse assemblages. We have solved this    problem by applying a non-linear optimisation algorithm that optimises Rao Q,    a closed-form functional trait diversity index that incorporates species    abundances, subject to other linear constraints. This framework generalises    previous models that only optimised the entropy of the community, and can    optimise both functional diversity and entropy simultaneously. This package    can also be used to generate experimental assemblages to test the effects    of community-level traits on community dynamics and ecosystem function. The    method is based on theory discussed in Laughlin (2014, Ecology Letters)    <doi.org/10.1111/ele.12288>."

"textrank",1,4,3,"2017-12-18 10:17","The 'textrank' algorithm is an extension of the 'Pagerank' algorithm for text. The algorithm allows to summarize text by calculating how sentences are related to one another. This is done by looking at overlapping terminology used in sentences in order to set up links between sentences. The resulting sentence network is next plugged into the 'Pagerank' algorithm which identifies the most important sentences in your text and ranks them.     In a similar way 'textrank' can also be used to extract keywords. A word network is constructed by looking if words are following one another. On top of that network the 'Pagerank' algorithm is applied to extract relevant words after which relevant words which are following one another are combined to get keywords.

This allows the use of simulated data that correctly accounts for pathway relationships and correlations. Here we present a versatile statistical framework to simulate  correlated gene expression data from biological pathways, by sampling from a multivariate normal distribution derived from a graph structure. This package allows the simulation of biological pathways from a graph structure based on a statistical model of gene expression. For example methods to infer biological pathways and gene regulatory networks from gene expression data can be tested on simulated datasets using this framework.

This package was designed and implemented for identifying disease similarities. It contains five functions which are 'DCEA', 'DCpathway', 'DS', 'comDCGL' and 'comDCGLplot'. In 'DCEA' function, differentially co-expressed genes and differentially co-expressed links are extracted from disease vs. health samples. Then 'DCpathway' function assigns differential co-expression values of pathways to be the average differential co-expression value of their component genes. Then 'DS' employs partial correlation coefficient of pathways as the disease similarity for each disease pairs. And 'DS' contains a permutation process for evaluating the statistical significant of observed disease partial correlation coefficients. At last, 'comDCGL' and 'comDCGLplot' sort out shared differentially co-expressed genes and differentially co-expressed links with regulation information and visualize them. "

Then, the algorithm removes links from the complete network with the probability as shown in the function ahn_prob(). Such link removals can make the network disconnected whereas a connected network is wanted.

The new functionalities are: 1) to create domain-centric ontologies; 2) to predict ontology terms for input protein sequences (precisely domain content in the form of architectures) plus to assess the predictions; 3) to reconstruct ancestral discrete characters using maximum likelihood/parsimony."

We extend and generalize the             approach of Balke and Pearl (1994) <doi:10.1016/B978-1-55860-332-5.50011-0> and we provide             a user friendly graphical interface for setting up such problems via directed acyclic             graphs (DAG), which only allow for problems within this class to be depicted. The user can             then define linear constraints to further refine their assumptions to meet their specific             problem, and then specify a causal query using a text interface. The program converts this             user defined DAG, query, and constraints, and returns tight bounds. The bounds can be             converted to R functions to evaluate them for specific datasets, and to latex code for             publication.

Understanding the community assembly mechanisms controlling biodiversity patterns is a central issue in ecology.

"SRS",0,18,2,"2020-08-31 12:00","Analysis of species count data in ecology often requires normalization to an identical sample size. Rarefying (random subsampling without replacement), which is a popular method for normalization, has been widely criticized for its poor reproducibility and potential distortion of the community structure. In the context of microbiome count data, researchers explicitly advised against the use of rarefying. An alternative to rarefying is scaling with ranked subsampling (SRS). SRS consists of two steps. In the first step, the total counts for all OTUs (operational taxonomic units) or species in each sample are divided by a scaling factor chosen in such a way that the sum of the scaled counts Cscaled equals Cmin. In the second step, the non-integer Cscaled values are converted into integers by an algorithm that we dub ranked subsampling. The Cscaled value for each OTU or species is split into the integer part Cint  (Cint = floor(Cscaled)) and the fractional part Cfrac (Cfrac = Cscaled - Cints). Since the sum of Cint is smaller or equal to Cmin, additional  delta C = Cmin - the sum of Cint counts have to be added to the library to reach the total count of Cmin. This is achieved as follows. OTUs are ranked in the descending order of their Cfrac values. Beginning with the OTU of the highest rank, single count per OTU is added to the normalized library until the total number of added counts reaches delta C and the sum of all counts in the normalized library equals Cmin. When the lowest Cfrag involved in picking delta C counts is shared by several OTUs, the OTUs used for adding a single count to the library are selected in the order of their Cint values. This selection minimizes the effect of normalization on the relative frequencies of OTUs. OTUs with identical Cfrag as well as Cint are sampled randomly without replacement.

"rocTree",0,2,3,"2019-10-11 01:20","Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC)-guided survival trees and ensemble algorithms are implemented, providing a unified framework for tree-structured analysis with censored survival outcomes. A time-invariant partition scheme on the survivor population was considered to incorporate time-dependent covariates. Motivated by ideas of randomized tests, generalized time-dependent ROC curves were used to evaluate the performance of survival trees and establish the optimality of the target hazard/survival function. The optimality of the target hazard function motivates us to use a weighted average of the time-dependent area under the curve (AUC) on a set of time points to evaluate the prediction performance of survival trees and to guide splitting and pruning. A detailed description of the implemented methods can be found in Sun et al. (2019) <arXiv:1809.05627>."

Second, the package allows to apply these measures on probability distributions resulting from random walks between the levels of tripartite graphs. By defining an initial distribution at a given level of the graph and a path to follow between the three levels, the probability of the walker's position within the final level is then computed, thus providing a particular instance of diversity to measure."
